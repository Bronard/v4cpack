-- Engine sound replacements! For you more clever character creators :)

-- To use this in your wad, import it and rename it as LUA_NAME (where NAME is whatever 4 letter name you decide on)

-- While you don't need to follow this formula exactly, the normal engine sounds in kart change as you build speed.
-- As such, they are made in a way that they get slightly higher pitched as your speed increases. With class A as
-- an example... sfx_krta00 is the lowest pitch (and also the sound you here while still), while sfx_krta12 is
-- the highest pitch (and will be heard once you reach top speed)

-- By Namolos (Or you can call me Nathan, idgaf)
-- If you use this, credit isn't required but greatly appreciated

-- Don't touch these :)

--     STUFF YOU SHOULD MODIFY    --
--================================--

-- Add your custom engine sounds inside the freeslot call, separated by commas. You can name them whatever you like,
-- but be sure to order them correctly in the call!
--
-- You probably know this, but the name corresponds to whatever you named the sound inside your wad, so...
--   Ex: DSKREX00 = sfx_krex00
--
--   Ex: freeslot("sfx_krex00", "sfx_krex01", ..., sfx_krex12)

freeslot("sfx_engh00",
         "sfx_engh01",
         "sfx_engh02",
         "sfx_engh03",
         "sfx_engh04",
         "sfx_engh05",
         "sfx_engh06",
         "sfx_engh07",
         "sfx_engh08",
         "sfx_engh09",
         "sfx_engh10",
         "sfx_engh11",
         "sfx_engh12")

-- This value must be set to the first sound you slotted in the freeslot() above, so following the example...
--   Ex: REPLACEMENTSOUNDS = sfx_krex00
local REPLACEMENTSOUNDS = sfx_engh00

-- Set the skinname of your character here
local SKINNAME = "sdhornet"

-- This value determines what engine class we're replacing, which is between A - I. Modify the last bit accordingly
local ENGINECLASS = D

-- The engine class is decided based on your kart character's stats. You'll want to make sure you select the engine class your
-- character is using
--
--  Class A: 1-3 speed, 1-3 weight (Ex: Tails)       =============
--  Class B: 4-6 speed, 1-3 weight                   = A = B = C =
--  Class C: 7-9 speed, 1-3 weight (Ex: Sonic)       =============
--  Class D: 1-3 speed, 4-6 weight                   = D = E = F =
--  Class E: 4-6 speed, 4-6 weight (Ex: Knuckles)    =============
--  Class F: 7-9 speed, 4-6 weight                   = G = H = I =
--  Class G: 1-3 speed, 7-9 weight (Ex: Eggman)      =============
--  Class H: 4-6 speed, 7-9 weight
--  Class I: 7-9 speed, 7-9 weight (Ex: Metal Sonic)
